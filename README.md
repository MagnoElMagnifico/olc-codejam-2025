# OLC Codejam 2025

Our submission to the [OLC CodeJam 2025], using the [Odin Programming Language].
This project is based on the [Web Odin Template] from Karl Zylinski (which he
explains in [this video]), using [Raylib].

The theme for this Jam was **shapes**.

# Building

    music notes, the counter, number of sides of the figure, etc.

    figures in a rectangular fashion.
